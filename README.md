# PROTECTING MY DATA USING NOTEPAD TRICK
I decided to upgrade the **Locker 1.0** project’s code since I have already told you that **“It was my first Program”**. It took me about 2 months to completely develop a locking program. The interface was although very weird and unpleasant, but I managed to complete my first self-started project. So, I named it **‘Locker v.2.0’**.

The program saves the **Username & Password** to a different location, rather than hard-coding it and included everything in the Program’s script. Thus, it is a little safer than **Locker v.1.0**. [unless you know the location of the Password file]

# LOCKER VERSION 3.0 BY KVC – IN VB & BATCH
Then after a few months, I thought to make this program more powerful and effective with a better data handling technique, And a better **UI (user interface)**. So, I moved towards  Visual Basic, and I started working on it using **Visual Studio**. And after a few months, I came up with the **Locker Version 3.0** By Kvc. {Hell of a lot of experiments I did at that time!}

As **VB** Provides pre-prepared UI for the programs, I didn’t need to make it from scratch. This version also uses some files of the previous version to accomplish its task. Although it is much stable and easy to understand than older versions of Locker.
